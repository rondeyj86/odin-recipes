# odin-recipes

I am building a basic recipe website

I made an index page and linked 3 different recipe pages. For the recipe pages I built out the lasagna.html page and then used that as a template for quesadilla.html and omelette.html. I made some minor changes to the indgredients and added different images to each page. The images were downloaded from recipe pages and then transferred from /Downloads to /repos/odin-recipes/images and linked to their respective webpages and the index page.
